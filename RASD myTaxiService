\section{Introduzione}


\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this Requirement Analysis Specification Document is
to


\subsection{Scope}

The scope is to develop the application MyTaxiService, that will be
useful to optimize the taxi service of the city. This application
will allow customers to request a taxi in the easiest way possible,
passing through a system which will keep track of drivers\textquoteright{}
availability. The system will choose the taxi for the customer and
notify both parties, without them needing to have a direct contact.
We want this application to be accessible from both smartphones and
computer browsers. It will also need two different interfaces, one
for each type of user: customer and taxi driver.

\subsection{Overview}

From section 2 onwards, this document will contain all details regarding
this project. 

Section 2 is an overall description of the problem, with more details
about the product itself, the characteristic of the user and constraints,
assumption and dependencies of the system.

Section 3 focuses on the specific requirements of each part of the
project .


\section{Overall Description}


\subsection{Product perspective}

``myTaxiService'' is a web and mobile app that relies on Google
Maps and PayPal for some functions, such as the payment of the service
or the localization of taxies. It will need to be able to interact
with these applications without delay or problems.

The app will be divided in two parts, one for the customers and the
other for the taxi driver. The look and functionalities of the two
will be different, but they will have to interoperate with each other
as well as the system. The customer interface must be prepared for
both browser and mobile app, while the drivers' interface must be
done only for mobile.


\subsubsection{Interfaces requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mobile app must be able to run on devices with one gigabyte of
ram and displays of three inches, on top of being able to work on
Android, iOS and Windows phone
\item The web app must be accessibile from all the most used browsers (Internet
Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Chrome...)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product functions}

The product will have two sets of functions, one for the drivers'
side and one for the customers' side.

The application for the drivers need to let them
\begin{itemize}
\item update their status (busy/available/offline)
\item accept or refuse calls from the system
\item modify their account
\end{itemize}
while the application for customers will have to let them
\begin{itemize}
\item call a taxi
\item make a reservation
\item check the position of the taxi the system got them
\item send a message to the system, like a complain
\item modify their account
\end{itemize}
and for both, there will need to be the functions
\begin{itemize}
\item register
\item log in
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User characteristics}

There are two types of intended users for this app: customers and
taxi drivers.

The customer will be of all age and educational level, no restriction
whatsoever. The drivers on the other hand, will need to have a valid
license, their own vehicle, and will have to respect all requirements
needed with their profession, that can vary from region to region.


\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system must respect the rules of taxi service of every region
and the cookies policy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenario}


\subsubsection{First scenario}

Tsukishima is training along with his teammates, and the exercise
is to run uphill until you reach the finish line. Unluckily, Tsukishima
really isn't feeling it today, and doesn't want to build up a sweat
running. He could walk all the way, but it would still take too much
effort, or he could try and find a different solution. He opens up
Google and searches for a way to call a taxi. He stumbles upon the
``myTaxiService'' site and decides to give it a try: he turns on
his GPS, leaves his name, surname and email and confirms his position
when the site asks for them and receives confirmation that a taxi
is on his way and should arrive in five minutes. The taxi driver arrives
on time, brings him to his destination and gets paid; Tsukishima is
happy with the result and decides to download the ``myTaxiService''
app on his phone and to sign up right away, leaving his name, surname
and email again along with a username and a password. Now the user
``MoonySaur11'' will be able to skip running exercises any time
he wants.


\subsubsection{Second scenario}

Paolo has a date a fateful friday afternoon, and wants to get the
tube from Cadorna to Loreto. But Paolo decided to have a date exactly
the day in which ATM had scheduled a strike. Seeing the awful situation
that is happening inside the station, he remembers about the myTaxiService
app he has on his phone and decides to use it. He calls for a taxi,
receives confirmation along with an estimated waiting time and the
taxi code and decides to go wait outside, even though it's raining.
Some minutes later, the system notifies Paolo that the driver is a
few minutes late, but when he looks to the real-time position of the
taxi on the application he notices that the symbol on the map is motionless
and the estimated time is growing. The customer waits another fifteen
minutes and is getting quite angry, when the driver finally shows
up, with sunglasses and Starbucks, to pick him up. Paolo arrives to
his destination late and his date thought that he'd been stood up,
so he left. Paolo is fuming when he opens the myTaxiService app to
complain about the service offered by taxi number 852399. The system
gets notified of the driver's behaviour and takes action about it.


\subsubsection{Third scenario}

Jennifer Wilson needs to go to London to meet one of his lovers. Since
she's leaving later in the day and doesn't want to risk not having
a taxi ready, she decides to reserve a taxi with the myTaxiService
app. She logs in, chooses the right functionality and inserts the
origin and destination of the trip and the time she wants to leave.
She also chooses to pay online with PayPal and after that, she goes
to finish preparing her pink suitcase.


\subsubsection{Fourth scenario}

A cabbie receives notification from the system that a certain ``PinkLadyRach''
needs a ride to London. He opens the app, accepts the job and gets
on the road. The cabbie picks up the lady, but instead of bringing
her to her destination he brings her to a secluded place, and offers
to play a game with her. Poor PinkLady couldn't know that her driver
was going to be a murderer that kills his victims with mind games
and poisonous pills. The cabbie wins the game, killing the lady, and
thus he no longer is servicing a customer. He takes out his smartphone
and changes is status on the app from ``busy'' to ``available'',
ready to go meet another unsuspecting victim.
